## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Hint
Next to the spare tile, in both the shift and the move step, a "Vihje" button SHALL show the turn
the bots' own strategy would choose for the viewer, without doing any of it. The hint MUST be
worked out on the viewer's device from what the viewer may know: the board, the spare tile, every
pawn, every player's found treasures and cards left, the last insertion, and the viewer's own
target; never another player's target. In the shift step it MUST preview the hinted shift like a
tapped arrow (that arrow selected, the spare turned to the hinted rotation) and mark the square to
walk to after it; the mark disappears while another shift or rotation is previewed. In the move
step it MUST mark the square to walk to. The same position MUST always give the same hint. The
button MUST be enabled only on the viewer's own turn while no command waits for the server, and
shown but disabled otherwise. Hints are not limited. The marked square MUST be told apart from the
reach and move marks by more than colour and MUST have a text alternative. It MUST also have a
colour of its own, not the colour of the reach and move marks, and it MUST draw the eye with a
gentle pulse that stays still when the viewer prefers reduced motion.

#### Scenario: Hint for the shift
- **WHEN** it is the viewer's shift step and they press "Vihje"
- **THEN** the board previews the hinted shift with its arrow selected and the spare turned, a ring marks the square to walk to, and nothing has been sent

#### Scenario: Following the hint
- **WHEN** the viewer confirms the hinted shift
- **THEN** in the move step the ring still marks the hinted square until the viewer moves

#### Scenario: Hint for the move
- **WHEN** it is the viewer's move step after their own shift and they press "Vihje"
- **THEN** a ring marks a reachable square to walk to, and the pawn has not moved

#### Scenario: Another shift previewed
- **WHEN** after a hint the viewer taps a different arrow
- **THEN** the preview shows that shift and the ring is gone

#### Scenario: Not your turn
- **WHEN** another player is taking their turn
- **THEN** the "Vihje" button is shown disabled

#### Scenario: Same position, same hint
- **WHEN** the viewer presses "Vihje" twice in the same position
- **THEN** both show the same shift and square

#### Scenario: Ring stands out
- **WHEN** the hint ring is shown next to reach rings or move outlines
- **THEN** it has a different colour from them and pulses gently

#### Scenario: Reduced motion
- **WHEN** the viewer prefers reduced motion and the hint ring is shown
- **THEN** the ring does not pulse
